The raw dataset (please refer to:  for this experiment was adopted from the literature [1], [2], which includes 260 expired pharmaceutical compounds evaluated as corrosion inhibitors. The dataset consists of two main components: fifteen features and one target. The target variable is the CIE value, while the input features include molecular and electronic parameters such as HOMO, LUMO, ionization potential (I), electron affinity (A), electronegativity (χ), electrophilicity (ω), hardness (η), softness (σ), fraction of shared electrons (∆N), polarizability (α), and physical and chemical parameters such as molecular weight (MW), acid dissociation constant (pKa), octanol-water partition coefficient (log P), water solubility (log S), polar surface area (PSA).
